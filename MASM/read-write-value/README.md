Read value and write value implementations in MASM

Wrote, tested and implemented my own ReadVal and WriteVal procedures for unsigned integers in MASM. Implemented macros getString and displayString. The macros may use Irvine's ReadString to get input from the user, and WriteString to display output. Write a small test program that gets 10 valid integers from the user and stores the numeric values in an array. The program then displays the integers, their sum, and their average.
