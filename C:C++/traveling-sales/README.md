traveling-salesman
==================

This was my final project for my Algorithms class. The task was to devise an algorithm to solve the famous Traveling Salesman problem. We were given text files consisting of city coordinates and we had to output a text.tour file showing the tour distance we calculated and the order of the cities (which was verified via a python program). More information on the problem and our solution can be found in the PDF.
