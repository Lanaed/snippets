/********************************************************************* 
 ** Program Filenames: assignment9_1.cpp
 ** Author: Ethan Spiro
 ** Class: CS 162
 ** Due Date: 2/14/14

 ** Description: Chapter 17, Programming Project 11 + modifications
 **
 ** The following figure is called a graph. The circles are called nodes and the lines are called edges. An 
 ** edge connects two nodes. You can interpret the graph as a maze of rooms and passages. The nodes 
 ** can be thought of as rooms and an edge connects one room to another. Note that each node has at most 
 ** four edges in the following graph. 
 ** See page 822 for the diagram. 
 
 ** Write a program that implements the previous maze using references to instances of a Node class. Each 
 ** node in the graph will correspond to an instance of Node . The edges correspond to links that connect 
 ** one node to another and can be represented in Node as instance variables that reference another Node 
 ** class. Start the user in node A. The userâ€™s goal is to reach the finish in node L. The program should 
 ** output possible moves in the north, south, east, or west direction. Sample execution is shown next. 

 ** Input: user choices for north, south west, east
 ** Output: current node, error messages, breadcrumbs and message upon completion
