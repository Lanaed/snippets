 ** Program Filenames: lab4_3.cpp
 ** Author: Ethan Spiro
 ** Class: CS 162
 ** Due Date: 2/9/14
 
 ** Description: Chapter 13, Programming project 7
 ** (You need to have first completed Programming Project 13.6 to work on this project.) When 
 ** computing a Fibonacci number using the most straightforward recursive function definition, the 
 ** recursive solution recomputes each Fibonacci number too many times. To compute Fi+2 = Fi + Fi+1 , 
 ** it computes all the numbers computed in F i a second time in computing Fi+1 . You can avoid this 
 ** by saving the numbers in an array while computing Fi . Write another version of your recursive 
 ** Fibonacci function based on this idea. In the recursive solution for calculating the N th Fibonacci 
 ** number, declare an array of size N. Array entry with index i stores the ith (i â€¦ N) Fibonacci 
 ** number as it is computed the first time. Then use the array to avoid the second (redundant) 
 ** recalculation of the Fibonacci numbers. Time this solution as you did in Programming Project 
 ** 13.6 , and compare it to your results for the iterative solution. 

 ** Input: choice of n
 ** Output: a user choice fib
