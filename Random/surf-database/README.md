Surfboard-Database
==================

This was a project I created for my database class. It is a customer, product, manufacturer, merchant database with the product being surfboards/surfboard accessories. I used PHP, mySql, HTML and CSS to create it.

More details including a detailed breakdown of the tables and their relationships, an ER diagram and a schema can befound in the PDF.
